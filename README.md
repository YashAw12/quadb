# Keeper App

Keeper App is a simple to-do list application built using React.js. It allows users to create, delete, mark tasks as complete, and persist their tasks even after page reload.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

### Installing

Follow these steps to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/keeper-app.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd keeper-app
```

3. Install dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

2. Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

### Usage

Once the application is running, you can perform the following actions:

- **Create a Task**: Type a title and content for your task in the input fields, then click the "Add" button.
- **Delete a Task**: Click the "DELETE" button next to the task you want to delete.
- **Mark a Task as Complete/Incomplete**: Click the "Mark Complete" or "Mark Incomplete" button next to the task to toggle its completion status.
- **Persisted Data**: Tasks are saved to local storage, so they will persist even after you reload the page.

### Built With
